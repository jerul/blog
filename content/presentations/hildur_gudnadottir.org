- She has written music both for film, TV, and also "standalone" albums, many in collaboration with longtime friends and even family. About this she says:
** Her music
"I think the most interesting way of going further and further within music [...] is to have a really long continued conversation. It's a little bit like the difference going to first dates all the time, to having a long term relationship. Small talk can be fun but it doesn't take you very deep. I think it's the same with music, so I tend to work with the same people for a really long time, and my musical friendships go on for decades".
